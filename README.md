# 📱 ONTOP - Personal Workspace Management App

A Flutter-based productivity app that combines contact management, project collaboration, task tracking, and smart call notifications into one seamless workspace.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Modern professionals juggle multiple contacts, projects, and tasks across different platforms, leading to:
- **Scattered Information**: Contacts, projects, and tasks stored in separate apps
- **Poor Collaboration**: Difficulty linking team members to specific projects
- **Missed Connections**: Unknown callers during important business hours
- **Inefficient Workflow**: Switching between multiple productivity apps

**ONTOP solves this by providing a unified workspace where contacts, projects, and tasks work together seamlessly.**
